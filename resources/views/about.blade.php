                <h3>What is LitecoinPledge?</h3>
                <p>LitecoinPledge is a service designed to allow people to donate to 
                    various projects on a monthly basis, or simply to have their pledges 
                    recorded one-time.</p>
                
                <h3>Is it limited to Litecoin projects?</h3>
                <p><strong>No.</strong> All projects are accepted, as long as you are willing to 
                accept Litecoin. This could be a litecoin-related project, or it could be a normal 
                charity, organisation etc.</p>
                
                <h3>Do you charge any fee for the pledges?</h3>
                <p>No. All pledges are fee/tax free. We instead hope that people 
                    use LitecoinPledge to pledge money to the service itself.</p>
                <p>It's up to you to deal with any local tax laws related to donated money.</p>
                
                <h3>How long will my deposit take?</h3>
                <p>Your deposit will be added to your account within a few minutes, assuming 
                    it has at least one confirmation</p>
